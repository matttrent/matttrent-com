However, without having first seen the left, the scale (in this case zooming in) shifts the dominant interpretation the right image is difficult to distinguish as an eye and glasses. Changing from a portrait in the left image to artifacts in the right image."

    The purpose of most images is to effectively convey information. Implicit in
    this assumption is the fact that the recipient of that information is a
    human observer, with a visual system responsible for converting raw sensory
    inputs into the perceived appearance. The appearance of an image not only
    depends on the image itself, but the conditions under which it is viewed as
    well as the response of human visual system to those inputs.
  </p>
  <p>
    This thesis examines the scale-dependent nature of image appearance, where
    the same stimulus can appear different when viewed at varying scales, that
    arises from the mechanisms responsible for processing spatial vision in the
    brain. In particular, this work investigates changes in the perception of
    blur and contrast resulting from the image being represented by different
    portions of the viewerâ€™s visual system due to changes in image scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    These methods take inspiration from the fundamental organization of spatial
    image perception into multiple parallel channels for processing visual
    information and employ models of human spatial vision to more accurately
    control the appearance of images under changing view- ing conditions. The
    result is a series of methods for understanding the blur and contrast
    present in images and manipulating the appearance of those qualities in a
    perceptually-meaningful way.
