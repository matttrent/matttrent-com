// TODO: Need to figure out how I want to handle images.
//
// The default Image behavior is to scale in the x-axis only with screen resizing.  That's
// not what I want.  The responsive-image class changes the behavior as I'd like.  But
// I'm not certain whether that's correct to use here as I have multiple images in a row,
// which probably means it's not actually BasicImage, and there's a second component for
// more general figures that expects more customization of its inputs.
//
// Leaving the original code as-is for now.  Will probably refactor my learnings into
// another component.
//
// Also check 2024-eastern-sierra-trip.mdx for comments on which image approaches work
// in MDX.

        Self-portrait of Chuck Close viewed at 2 scales. The left image is
        clearly recognizable as a portrait, even thought it contains the same
        diamond-shaped artifacts as the right. However, without having first
        seen the left, the right image is difficult to distinguish as an eye and
        glasses. Changing the scale (in this case zooming in) shifts the
        dominant interpretation from a portrait in the left image to artifacts
        in the right image.

    <p>
      The purpose of most images is to effectively convey information. Implicit
      in this assumption is the fact that the recipient of that information is a
      human observer, with a visual system responsible for converting raw
      sensory inputs into the perceived appearance. The appearance of an image
      not only depends on the image itself, but the conditions under which it is
      viewed as well as the response of human visual system to those inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This thesis examines the scale-dependent nature of image appearance, where
      the same stimulus can appear different when viewed at varying scales, that
      arises from the mechanisms responsible for processing spatial vision in
      the brain. In particular, this work investigates changes in the perception
      of blur and contrast resulting from the image being represented by
      different portions of the viewerâ€™s visual system due to changes in image
      scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      These methods take inspiration from the fundamental organization of
      spatial image perception into multiple parallel channels for processing
      visual information and employ models of human spatial vision to more
      accurately control the appearance of images under changing view- ing
      conditions. The result is a series of methods for understanding the blur
      and contrast present in images and manipulating the appearance of those
      qualities in a perceptually-meaningful way.
