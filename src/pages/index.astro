    <h2>Now</h2>

    <p>
      I work on Generative AI at <a href="/cv#meta">Meta</a>, where I spend a
      lot of time thinking about training data.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not doing that, I'm usually trying to get lost in the wilderness.
      I camp, hike, find things to drive over, and spend a fair amount of time
      getting to out of the way places to <a
        href="http://instagram.com/matttrent">photograph them</a
      >.

    <h2>Previous eras</h2>

    <p>
      At <a href="/cv#figma">Figma</a> and <a href="/cv#sprig">Sprig</a>, I
      found myself in a variety of data science roles from 2014-2017.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <a href="/cv#adobe">Adobe</a> and <a href="/cv#pocket-pixels"
        >Pocket Pixels</a
      >, I worked on a number of projects in the early days of mobile
      photography from 2011-2014.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <a href="/cv#dolby">Dolby</a> and <a href="/cv#brightside"
        >BrightSide</a
      >, prior to their acquisition, I worked on high dynamic range displays
      from 2004-2009.
    </p>

    <p>
      My <a href="/cv#phd">Ph.D.</a> is in image processing and human visual perception
      at University of British Columbia, from 2003-2012.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention
          of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of
          attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the
          overabundance of information...
