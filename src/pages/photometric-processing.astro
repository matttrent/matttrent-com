        Left: original HDR image, tone mapped for display. Center: high
        contrast, low frequency image representing the LED backlight. Right: LCD
        image corresponding to backlight. The combination of the backlight and
        LCD image will reconstruct the original image.

    <p>
      Many real-world scenes contain a dynamic range that exceeds conventional
      display technology by several orders of magnitude. Through the combination
      of several existing technologies, new high dynamic range displays, capable
      of reproducing a range of intensities much closer to that of real
      environments, have been constructed. These benefits come at the cost of
      more optically complex devices; involving two image modulators, controlled
      in unison, to display images. We present several methods of rendering
      images to this new class of devices for reproducing photometrically
      accurate images. We discuss the process of calibrating a display, matching
      the response of the device with our ideal model. We then derive series of
      methods for efficiently displaying images, optimized for different
      criteria and evaluate them in a perceptual framework.
