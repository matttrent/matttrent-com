One of my favorite things from the early days of personal websites and blog was that people would often have a page describing how they built their site. The frameworks we use today for building websites and content management were just in their infancy, and early folks cooked up their own approach to their websites out of necessity. People took pride in their work and often had a page describing how they did it. The publishing term *colophon*, the part of a book for information about the publication of the book, was adopted for this corresponding aspect of websites.
