One of my favorite things from the early days of personal websites and blog was that people would often have a page describing how they built their site.  The frameworks we use today for building websites and content management were just in their infancy, and more often than not early folks cooked up their own approach to their website.  People took pride in their work and often had a page describing how they did it.  In publishing, the *colophon* is the part of the book where a publisher shares information about the publication of the book.  And the term was commonly applied to websites as well.
