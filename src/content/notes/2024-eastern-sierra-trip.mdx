Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means readability of graphics and their accompanying text without extra clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.

Figures should try to use the `figure` element, which by default are constrained to the main column. Don’t wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin note inside the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion, like so:

Going to add some extra text here to test the margin note.  Making space so that one note doesn't overlap with the next.

<MarginNote name="exports-imports">
  <figure slot="content">
  <img src="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/exports-imports.png" 
    alt="Exports and Imports to and from Denmark & Norway from 1700 to 1780" />
  </figure>

  But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a <code>p</code> tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.

If you need a full-width figure, give it the `fullwidth` class. Make sure that’s inside an `article`, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From *Beautiful Evidence*, page 122-124.

</figure>
