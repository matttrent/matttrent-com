Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means readability of graphics and their accompanying text without extra clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.

Figures should try to use the `figure` element, which by default are constrained to the main column. Don’t wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin note inside the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion, like so:

Going to add some extra text here to test the margin note.  Making space so that one note doesn't overlap with the next.

Hi there.  why isn't modified date changing when I update this.  Trying again.  And again.  One more update.

Hello.

<Sidenote num={false}><img src="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/rhino.png" alt="Image of a Rhinoceros"/> F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zooological Literature,” <em>Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice</em> (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s <em>Visual Explanations</em>.</Sidenote>
But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte's work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a `p` tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.

If you need a full-width figure, give it the `fullwidth` class. Make sure that’s inside an `article`, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From *Beautiful Evidence*, page 122-124.
