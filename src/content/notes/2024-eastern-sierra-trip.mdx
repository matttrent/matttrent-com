## A preface about motivation

Which I will eventually move somewhere else.  The idea for creating photo journals, and the entire website redesign, started a few months ago.  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to do a photography mentorship with [Jakob Lilja-Ruiz](https://www.jakoblr.com/) (aka [portra papi](https://www.instagram.com/portra_papi)) earlier this year.  Jakob dedicated one of those weeks to curating your work, a skill he felt was the most underrated in photography.

Curation is something I've never put much thought to.  I cull the bad photos, but hadn't really considered how to arrange the good, and have tried over the past 6 months.  This practice took the form of attempting to curate series to post on Instagram, but I struggled with it.  I wasn't finding imaginative choices, mostly was mostly coming up with collections of similar things like silhouettes or certain landscapes.  And the required regularity of posting that social media encourages made it feel like a chore.  I found myself wanting a different format in which to think about curation.

Many of the highlights of my year, both experientially and photographically, are the roadtrips I take exploring the Western US and documenting those travels has already been the focus of my photography for several years.  Taking inspiration from [Bound for Nowhere](https://www.boundfornowhere.com/) and [Adventure Taco](https://adventuretaco.com/), I realized the curation I was most interested in was documenting the those travels in both prose and visual.  I imagine that being a thread I can pull on to spend more time with my collection and think about curation, starting with travel chronologies and expanding to other forms in time.

And so I set about doing so in my standard fashion.  Rather than start a photo site using any of the high quality options that exist, I completely rebuilt my website from scratch.  I wanted to control over how I combined text and image and am building the pieces that allow me to do so.  This is the first attempt at doing so.  It's not quite where I'd like it to be, but it's good enough to start.

## The trip

This was a short trip with modest ambitions.  I was in need of a few nights camping and a general change of scenery.  No strong itinerary or route to keep to this this time.  I wanted to get a least one good hike in.  I had rented the Fujifilm 55-140 telephoto lens wanted to dedicate time to photography sessions and understand where I could use that in the pictures I want to make.  

The Eastern Sierra is my favorite part of California, and I try to visit it at least once a year.  I had missed last year's visit and it was time for a catch up.  So I packed and gassed up the truck and headed east.  

The goal for the first day was to make it to Bishop, a 5 Â½ hour drive from the Bay Area.  My focus for much of the day was to put down miles and I don't have much to say on the first 4 hours of the day.  The Central Valley, Sierra foothills, and Yosemite passed without any notable stops.  I had places to be and the midday light wasn't presenting anything worth stopping for.  

The aspect that stood out most was the smell.  Ponderosa Pine begin to enter the forest mix around 3000 feet elevation.  That pine smell, especially the dry flinty notes of late summer, is one of the most classically Sierra things to me, and the first encounter on any trip is a statement of "welcome home".  

Once I made it past the eastern gate of Yosemite, I was done with the "get there" miles, and  stopped to collect myself.  I was back in [Basin and Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basin_and_Range_Province) country.  The change going from the western slope of the Sierra to the eastern slope is quite abrupt.  The white granite is traded for red and brown country rock.  The pine for sage.  And the sense of being in the forest is replaced with that of being an open plain, facing a wall of rock.  A few quick shots were made, but my main interest was in making camp.

I made it to Bishop and started searching for dispersed camping options.  This trip was a bit last minute and a bit play-it-by-ear, so I didn't have camping options as well researched as I would for most trips.  I searched some areas north of town, but didn't find anything to my liking.  I debated heading to another area to continue the search, but "sunset" here is much earlier thanks to the looming Sierra crest to the west.  So I decided to go for the easy option and snag a spot in a BLM campground.

While a BLM campground is rarely anything special, it allowed me to spend the time watching the sunset progress across the mountains, rather than racing the sunset trying to find a spot to call camp for the night.  Camp presented a good view of the light on both the Sierra range southwest of Bishop as well as the White range on the opposite of the valley.  The immediate area wasn't photogenic in itself (it is a BLM camp after all), but it did present a good opportunity to experiment with the longer telephoto zoom I rented for the trip.

I cooked dinner watching the light creep behind the Sierra crest.   The way the air in the Sierra seems hold the light is something else, as in this shot of the air adjacent the peak being illuminated alongside it.  After the light was gone from the mountains and the last light was illuminating the clouds, I happened to find this pair of complementary ones looking toward and away from sunset.  And with that I called it a night.
